I am an Assistant Professor at Department of Computer Science & Engineering, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST) since Fall 2024. I lead the [HKUST Mobile, Intelligent, and Networked System (MINSys) Group](https://xmouyang.github.io/Team/). Before joining HKUST, I was a postdoctoral researcher at Networked & Embedded Systems Lab of UCLA ECE department, working with [Prof. Mani Srivastava](https://www.ee.ucla.edu/mani-srivastava/). I obtained my Ph.D. degree in Information Engineering, from The Chinese University of Hong Kong in 2023, advised by [Prof. Guoliang Xing](https://staff.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/~glxing/), and co-advised by [Prof. Jianwei Huang](https://jianwei.cuhk.edu.cn/). I also worked closely with [Prof. Jiayu Zhou](https://jiayuzhou.github.io/) in my PhD.

My research interest is building **AI-powered mobile and IoT systems**, with a primary focus on developing efficient machine learning and sensing systems for **smart health** applications.

- **Machine Learning for IoT Systems**: address real-world data and system challenges for advancing ML in mobile/IoT systems.
- **Smart Health**: design and deploy real-world IoT systems for personalized health monitoring and intervention, e.g., [monitoring digital biomarkers of Alzheimerâ€™s Disease](https://cuhk-alzheimers-ai.github.io/).
- **Mobile Sensing**: enhance sensing quality with physics-strengthened AI techniques, e.g., exposing high-resolution texture information from ToF cameras.

<!-- 
**Key words of my recent research topics:** Multi-Modal Sensing and Learning, Federated Learning Systems, Large Language Models, Activity Recognition, Digital Biomarkers, ToF Depth Sensing Systems.
-->

I am actively looking for highly motivated students to join my group (**Earliest round for Ph.D./M.Phil: 2025 Spring/Fall**). See [openings](https://xmouyang.github.io/opening/) for more details. Please [email me](xmouyang@cse.ust.hk) your CV and transcript if you are interested in.
