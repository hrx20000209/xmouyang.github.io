1. Create a new repository named`<your-github-username>.github.io`.
2. Clone this repository and push two branches(`master`, `gh-pages`) to the new repo.
2. In this new repository, go to `Settings -> Actions -> General -> Workflow permissions` and give `Read and write permissions` to GitHub Actions.
3. Open file `_config.yml`, set `url` to `https://<your-github-username>.github.io` and leave `baseurl` **empty** (do NOT delete it).
4. Wait until the GitHub actions finish (check your repository **Actions** tab). Now, in addition to the master branch, your repository has a newly built gh-pages branch.
5. Finally, in the repository page go to `Settings -> Pages -> Build and deployment`, make sure that `Source` is set to `Deploy from a branch` and set the branch to `gh-pages` (NOT to master).
